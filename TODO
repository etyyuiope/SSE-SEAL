1. Detach the server from the client (which is the current design for experiment);
2. Modify the interfaces provided by the OramAccessController to communicate with the remote server;
3. For SSE-search, use RPC (Remote Process Call, e.g., Gooels' GRPC C++ library) to complete the process and to communicate with the database;
4. (maybe) Implement oram in UDF (but openGauss may not support UDFs).

---------- For gRPC ----------
1. Wrap the client with the clientRunner class.
2. Implement server-side ORAM scheme.
3. Rewrite interfaces in OramAccessController.
